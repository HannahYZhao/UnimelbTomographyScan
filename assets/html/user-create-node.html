        <h1>How can I create a New Node?</h1>

        <p>For a standard user, you cannot create a new Node. If you want something new added, you will need to get in contact with the current person responsible for this application's source code and request that they add it for you. If you are confident in your Python skills, you might even be able to code it for them after taking a look at the Developer side of things.</p>
