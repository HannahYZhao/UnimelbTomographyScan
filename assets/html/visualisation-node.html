                allow a person to select .vtk files. Once this has been done, the file name

        <ul>
            <li>If the dropdown is set to display 1 image per page, then it will show the image in 4orientations: its original orientation as well as sagittal, transversal, and coronal.</li>
            <li>If more than one image is shown per page, then only 1 orientation is shown. Users can choose the orientation using the dropdown at the top next to the camera button.</li>
            <li>Once the dropdown is set, and the rendered file would show up on the right hand side.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Generating Log File</h3>

            <li>Once rendered, each image will have a <strong>Log</strong> button. When selected, a File Icon should appear on the left hand side near the file name. </li>
            <li>Once all desired images have been selected, you can use <strong>Create Log File</strong> node to generate a log file with a timestamp and the list of all file names selected to be logged.</li>
