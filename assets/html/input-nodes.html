    <h1>Input Nodes</h1>
    <h2>Select Folder Node</h2>
    <h3>How to use this node?</h3>
    <p>
        This is a very simple node that does the simple job of selecting a folder.
        It has a simple layout consisting of one button, "Select Folder". Upon pressing
        this button, the user will be presented with a directory selection dialog. Here
        the user can select a directory which can be used to save files to or get files
        from depending on the process use case. Due to its generality, it can be used in
        various circumstances. The node, when connected, will simply output the path of
        the directory on the local computer to the next node which can choose to process
        however it wants.
    </p>
    <p>
        Its use includes but is not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Providing a folder containing .gipl files for SPHARM Node</li>
        <li>Providing the root folder of TFMAT files for Alignment Node</li>
        <li>Providing an empty folder to save log files for SPHARM Node and Visualisation Node</li>
        <li>Providing a root folder for Create Directories Node as the process workspace</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Select VTK Files Node</h2>
    <h3>How to use this node?</h3>
    <p>
        Select VTK Files Node has a very simple job. It allows the user to select the
        VTK files that will be used for processing. It has a simple layout that displays
        a button, a label that shows the number of files currently selected and a list view
        displaying the files that have been selected. The user can click the button to open
        a file selection dialog which will restrict the user to only select file with the
        extension ".VTK". The user can select multiple files. Once the files are selected,
        the label will update to show the number of files selected and the view will show the
        files that were selected. If this node is connected to a valid node, the list of
        selected files will be passed on to the next node in the process.
