        <h1>Developing Custom Widgets</h1>
        <h3>What are Widgets?</h3>
        <p>Widgets are designed to appear on the node itself. You may see the various widgets that are defined currently in the nodes. The FileOpen node displays an 
            "Open File" button and a list view displaying any selected files.
            While this is good for small widgets, you may want to implement bigger widgets or dialogs which are more dynamic and harder to define. These can 
            be defined within the node itself based on some trigger such as an input or the node becoming "Runnable" (as defined in the SPHARM node) which calls a function
            in the update_event method of the node. This function can then refer to any PySide based widget that runs its own process. Another alternative is to use a
            button widget as a trigger to open other dialogs or widgets.</p>

        <h3>How can I create a New Widget?</h3>
        <p>New widgets can be created and defined in the widgets.py file found in procBuilder. To be displayed on the node, you must set the parameter:
            main_widget_class = Your Widget and main_widget_pos = "between ports" or "below_ports". You should now be able to see your widget on the node. You
            can customise the widget however you like using the PySide2 library, such as using it as a trigger to open further dialog boxes or visually modify data etc.</p>
        
        <h3>How can I communicate with my Widget?</h3>
        <p>You can talk to the widget on the node or vice versa using Signals and Slots. If you want to access some information from the widget such as 
            any selected files and pass it to the node so that you can output them to the next node in the process, you can define a signal in the widget, for example
            value_changed = Signal(object). Now in your node, you can define a slot to access that value whenever value_changed is updated:
            self.main_widget().value_changed.connect(self.main_widget_val_changed) where self.main_widget_val_changed is a callback defined as follows:
            def main_widget_val_changed(self, val):
                self.val = val
                self.update()
        </p>
