        <h3>How to use this node?</h3>
        <p>
            File Open node has a very simple job. It allows the user to select the VTK files that will be used for processing.
            It has a simple layout that displays a button, a label that shows the number of files currently selected and a list view displaying the
            files that have been selected. The user can click the button to open a file selection dialog which will restrict the user to only select
            file with the extension ".VTK". The user can select multiple files. Once the files are selected, the label will update to show the number
            of files selected and the view will show the files that were selected. If this node is connected to a valid node, the list of selected files
            will be passed on to the next node in the process.
