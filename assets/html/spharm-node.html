    <h1>SPHARM Node</h1>

    <p>The SPHARM node allows a user to convert .gipl files to .vtk files. It calls SPHARM-PDM modules in SlicerSALT,
        a application that must be installed. SlicerSALT
        can be downloaded here: http://salt.slicer.org/</p>

    <h3>Selecting animal type</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Select the animal type from three options: rabbit, rat and mouse.</li>
        <li>Depending on the type selected, the parameters for the SPHARM-PDM module will be set. You will be able
            to modify these later before running SPHARM-PDM.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Loading Files</h3>
    <p>
        This node has four inputs as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Select the input folder for the .gipl files. Files cannot be individually selected.</li>
        <li>Select a folder as a working directory. This will store .ini files that are generated in order to direct
            the SPHARM-PDM module. Two .ini files will be created, one for the low resolution images, another for
            the high resolution images. A third file will be put in this folder - SPHARM-PDM.py - which is also
            needed to run the SPHARM-PDM module
        </li>
        <li>Select a output folder for low resolution images. These will be used later to calculate the principle
            components.
        </li>
        <li>Select a output folder for high resolution images. These can be used for visualisation purposes.
    </ul>

    <h3>Select SlicerSALT location</h3>
    <p>In order to run the SPHARM-PDM module, you must select the location of the SlicerSALT application.
    <ul>
        <li>Example location: C:/Program Files/SlicerSALT 3.0.0/SlicerSALT.exe</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Low Parameters</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>sx, sy and sz indicate the rescale factors. They should be set to the same amount.</li>
        <li>SubdivLevel value - subdivision level - the lower the value, the less detailed the result.</li>
        <li>You can select a flip template. This is a .coeff file that would have been generated previously from
            running SPHARM-PDM. This is used to ensure the output is flipped consistently.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>High Parameters</h3>
    <p>
        As before, except that these are the values for the high resolution images. The subdivision level should be
        greater.
    </p>

    <h3>Writing Parameters</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click run to begin the process of creating two .ini files. These will be used to configure the SPHARM-PDM
            module.
        </li>
        <li>Information about what the files contain is outputted on the console. Some parameters that are automatically
            set:
            ('label', '0'), ('gauss', 'False'), ('iter', '1000'), ('medialmesh', 'True'), ('phiiteration', '100'),
            ('thetaiteration', '100'), ('regparatemplatefileon', 'False')
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Generating Low meshes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Click run to begin the process of creating low resolution meshes</li>
        <li>This may take 1 - 2 minutes per file, depending on the paramaters selected</li>
        <li>Three folders will be generated: Step1_SegPostProcess, Step2_GenParaMesh, Step3_ParaToSPHARMMesh</li>
        <li>Later, the node will output the locations of the files X_pp_surf_SPHARM.vtk, where X is the gipl file
            name. Example. input of RAT_RE_16_LL_HE1_T_MSK.gipl creates RAT_RE_16_LL_HE1_T_MSK_pp_surf_SPHARM.gipl
        </li>
        <li>After the process has finished, you will be informed if any files are missing. This may be caused by
            using inappropriate parameters.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Generating High meshes</h3>
    <p>The same as generating low meshes, except the high resolution .ini file is used to set the parameters
    </p>

    <h3>SPHARM verification</h3>
    <p>A table displaying images of the output files can be used to verify the result. If the images appear distorted
        you may need to re-run using different parameters.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Select from low, high or both to change what the table displays</li>
        <li>Selecting both displays the low and high resolution images.</li>
        <li>4 views are displayed for each image: 3d, Transverse, Coronal and Sagittal</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>PCA verification</h3>
    <p>A table displaying the high resolution images with the PCA vectors. This can be used to verify if your
        input gipl files have been correctly cropped. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each vector is displayed using a different color, check the Key to see which color corresponds to Longest,
            Middle and Shortest
        </li>
        <li>Select any files that are incorrectly cropped. The node will output the corresponding select gipl files
            that you can then use with a different module to re-crop them.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>A summary of the files that the module will output: low resolution files, high resolution files and gipl files
        select for re-cropping.</p>
