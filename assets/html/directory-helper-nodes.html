    <h1>Directory Helper Nodes</h1>
    <h2>Connector Node</h2>
    <h3>How to use this node?</h3>
    <p>
        The job of this node is simple. As its name suggests, it passes a
        directory path without any modification. It can help maintain the
        readability of a process by avoiding long and staggered connection
        lines.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Copy File Node</h2>
    <h3>How to use this node?</h3>
    <p>
        The function of this node is also intuitive, it receives a list of
        files and a directory path from its inputs. It will copy the files
        into the directory folder.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Create Folder Structure Node</h2>
    <h3>How to use this node?</h3>
    <p>
        As one process may need to have several folders to save different
        kinds of files, this node will create a root folder as a workspace
        to manage files. It will receive a directory path from a Select
        Folder node, and it will create the following subfolders:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ini</strong>: to store the .ini file with the parameters chosen on the SPHARM node</li>
        <li><strong>low res vtk</strong>: to store the files generated by SlicerSalt when creating the low-res mesh</li>
        <li><strong>low res clean vtk</strong>: to store the low-res .vtk files</li>
        <li><strong>high res vtk</strong>: to store the files generated by SlicerSalt when creating the high-res mesh</li>
        <li><strong>high res clean vtk</strong>: to store the high-res .vtk files</li>
        <li><strong>TFMAT</strong>: to store the TFMAT files created in Calculate TFMAT node in  Alignment Node</li>
        <li><strong>aligned</strong>: to store the aligned high-res .vtk files created by Aligned VTK Files node in Alignment Node</li>
        <li><strong>log</strong>: to store the log files</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This node has eight outputs for the subfolders above respectively.
        Hence the user can connect them with other nodes to use these folders
        to store files.
