        <h1>Select Folder Node</h1>
        <h3>How to use this node?</h3>
        <p>
            This is a very simple node that does the simple job of selecting a folder. It has a simple layout consisting of one button, "Select Folder".
            Upon pressing this button, the user will be presented with a directory selection dialog. Here the user can select a directory which can be 
            used to save files to or get files from depending on the process use case. Due to its generality, it can be used in various circumstances.
            The node, when connected, will simply output the path of the directory on the local computer to the next node which can choose to process
            however it wants.
