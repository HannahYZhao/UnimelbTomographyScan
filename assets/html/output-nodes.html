  <h3>How to use this node?</h3>
  <p>
    This node performs a save function. It connects to the visualisation node
    or SPHARM node outputs and saves the outputs in appropriate files. For
    example, The visualisation node provides two outputs, a list of valid VTK
    files and a list of invalid VTK files. When this node is connected, one
    each to each output, it will recognise the type of output and save it
    accordingly. Moreover, user can specify the log file's name by typing in
    the test field of this node. The log file's name would be timestamp_name.txt.
  </p>
  <p>
    It has two inputs. The "Logged Files" port will receive a list of file names
    to be logged, the "destination folder" port will provide a folder path from
    a Select Folder node and this node will save a text file there.
