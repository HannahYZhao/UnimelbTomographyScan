        <h3>How to use this node?</h3>
        <p>
            This node performs a save function. It connects to the visualisation node outputs and saves the outputs in appropriate files.
            The visualisation node provides two outputs, a list of valid VTK files and a list of invalid VTK files. When this node is connected,
            one each to each output, it will recognise the type of output and save it accordingly. The layout is very simple, it has one button to
            "Select Folder". When pressed, this button simply selects a folder path and saves it in the node.
            If the button is pressed before any input is passed or process is run, it will allow the user to select a directory in which the file 
            (valid or invalid VTK depending on which output its connected to) will be saved. So, when the user runs the process, the file will be
            automatically saved in that directory each time until a new directory is selected.
            If the button is not pressed before running the process, it will automatically open a file dialog that will allow the user to manually
            navigate to the required directory and save the file there.
